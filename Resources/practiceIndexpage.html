            <h3>What We Offer</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 1em;">We've created a system for learning guitar based on music theory that helps you stretch beyond the confines of the traditional way music theory is taught and learned. What normally happens is students are taught a traditional method of learning chords. After you learn these chords the teacher askes the students what songs they want to learn to play. So the student learns songs.</p>
            <h4>Why This Sucks</h4>
            <p>The issue with this approach is the student learns how to play songs that after they've learned ten or so songs, it all becomes a monotonous rut. Where do they go from there. If a guitar teacher was honest and really wanted to help the developement of their students into great guitar players, they'd lay out a syllabus of first we learn these, then then this, and then so on and on. Showing the student that there is a path that they can follow to get them to the place where they are the guitarist they dream of being.</p>
            <h4>What Can We Do About It?</h4>
            <p>How can a student of guitar escape this rut and move on to truly mastering the instrument the way they've always wanted. We propose that a path be laid out. Show them that a large chunk of guitar and music learning is indeed finite and has a mastery point. While also keeping in mind that learning an instrument is indeed not a finite proposal with a set number of steps and then BAM, you now know all of guitar. But giving the student a path and hope that they can learn enough to a certain point that they can play the music they are inspired to play, before they give up, because the path is daunting and never ending.</p>
            <p>This path and the way through it is what we offer with our products from Muugle. Muugle wants to hold your hand on your music learning path, to the point of satisfaction where you know where you are, where you are going, and how to get there. Muugle believes in you, and we want to help you believe in you. Together we will achieve greatness. </p>
